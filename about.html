        <h3>My name's Tom. I am a User Experience (UX) Designer, who combines passions for art and design with a strong desire to deliver world-class IT services to customers.</h3>


        <p>Over the last fifteen years, since leaving full-time education I have pursued a number of work-based apprenticeships: I have held roles as UX Designer, Business Analyst, Scrum Master, Agile Coach, Call Centre Team Manager, Customer Service Advisor, and Market Research Telephone Interviewer. I also spent two years working for free as a Listening Volunteer for the Samaritans, answering calls at night made to their suicide hotline by people suffering emotional crisis. 
I have spent the last three years working with Push Doctor and before that BrightHR, leading the design of their cloud-based web services and platforms. Before that, I worked with clients including Co-operative Food, the Co-operative Group, Bupa and LateRooms. Before that I spent 7 more years in the customer service industry as a Team Manager and Customer Service Advisor.
