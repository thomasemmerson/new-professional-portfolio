	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<h3>Who am I?</h3>

        <p>Hi! My name's Tom. Tom Emmerson. Thomas David Emmerson. I'm thirty-five and I live in North Cyprus. My wife, my son and I moved here in 2019. Our son was conceived here using IVF methods back in 2016 so this is a cause and a place that’s very dear to both of us.</p>
	<p>I’ve had a lot of jobs. I've worked in private medical insurance, technology, information technology, supermarkets, call centres, market research, hospitality, food retail, insurance underwriting.</p>
	<h3>What do I do now?</h3>
	<p>Until 2019 I'd worked in IT and software design for 8 years. I worked  in medium to large enterprises, in sectors including health, insurance, regulation, food retail, cloud services and financial management.</p>
	<p>Doing what? I worked with customers and tried to understand what they wanted. Using that information, I helped some of these businesses realign their models, processes and systems. The thing I most enjoyed doing though in all these businesses was helping design and build new things.</p>
	<h3>What do I want to do next?</h3>
	      <p>I like art.</p>
	      <p>I like technology.</p>
	      <p>I am inspired by people who build beautiful things or things that do really cool jobs. I would love to do anything remotely like that. I am always looking for new opportunities, especially ones that are new or interesting. I know, it’s vague.</p>
	      <h3>How can you learn more about me?</h3>


	
        <p>If you'd like to see a well-curated and organised history of my previous jobs, please see my LinkedIn profile, viewable <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomemmersonba/">here</a>.</p>
	      <p>If, on the other hand, you are more interested in what I'm doing now and what I may do next, please check back here periodically for updates.
