	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name's Tom. Tom Emmerson. Thomas David Emmerson. I'm thirty-five, I'm married to a gorgeous and wonderful girl called Toni and we have an amazing son called Toby who at the time of this writing is two and a half. We live in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (North Cyprus is what most call it to save time!) My wife has her dream job - she works as a Patient Co-ordinator for an IVF Clinic here in Cyprus. Our son was conceived using IVF methods back in 2016 so this is acause very dear to both of us, and the thought that she gets to get up each day and go help other people start their miracle family just makes my heart burst with joy every time. I could not be more proud of her. I have had a long and very varied career - and that word really is a good one to use. It feels as though I've careered from every job it's been possible to have to the next one! I've worked in private medical insurance, technology, information technology, supermarkets, call centres, market research, hospitality, food retail, insurance underwriting, the list goes on and on...</p>
	      
	<h3>What do I do now?</h3>
	<p>Until earlier this year, I'd worked in IT and software design for 8 years. Most of that time has been spent working in medium to large enterprises, in sectors including health, insurance, regulation, food retail, cloud services and financial management. I started with customers and their needs; and helped businesses to realign their models, processes and systems. Doing this helped me develop a deep understanding of the problems facing those businesses. I then created process and system-based solutions to address those problems. I have led the design process from initial ideation and problems, prototype creation and process diagramming, via early concept-modelling, to full visual design and finally producing a product backlog of fully-realised software requirements and acceptance criteria. But... then <p>Right now at the time of writing this - December 2019 - my wife, my son and I are living in a beautiful rented villa in a village called Catalkoy just off the Northern coast of Northern Cyprus. My wife works in Lefkosa which is half an hour away by car, my son goes to a dual-language school in Bellapais which is fifteen minutes away by car. And I? Well, currently I work at home, by making calls to people in the UK to ask them to take part in market research surveys arranged by a UK-based market research agency. It's easy work and it pays well (and most importantly, it pays in English Sterling which means the exchange rate against the Turkish Lira is great). But I am always looking at other opportunities. My life's dream is to be a writer - fiction or non-fiction, that part doesn't really matter to me. What does matter is that I love writing; I love words, i always have. In English exams at school, I would beam with a smile when I realised that the last 40% of an exam paper's marks were awarded based on the participant's ability to write a story of their own devising. Because I knew just in that moment... I would always get the full 40% of marks. Every. Time.</p>
        <h3>What do I want to do next?</h3>
	<p>My mission is to bridge the divide between art and technology. I want to design and build beautiful things. I'm now seeking my next role, wherever that may take me. It's important that wherever and whatever it is, I can use creativity and divergent thinking to help solve problems. By nature I'm artistic and curious, so I'm seeking a role that helps me develop those traits.</p>
	<h3>How can you learn more about me?</h3>
