	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name's Tom.</p>
	<h3>What do I do now?</h3>
	<p>I've worked in IT and software design for 8 years. Most of that time has been spent working in medium to large enterprises, in sectors including health, insurance, regulation, food retail, cloud services and financial management. I start with customers and their needs; and help businesses to realign their models, processes and systems. Doing this helped me develop a deep understanding of the problems facing those businesses. I then created process and system-based solutions to address those problems. I have led the design process from initial ideation and problems, prototype creation and process diagramming, via early concept-modelling, to full visual design and finally producing a product backlog of fully-realised software requirements and acceptance criteria.</p>
        <h3>What do I want to do next?</h3>
	<p>My mission is to bridge the divide between art and technology. I want to design and build beautiful things. I'm now seeking my next role, wherever that may take me. It's important that wherever and whatever it is, I can use creativity and divergent thinking to help solve problems. By nature I'm artistic and curious, so I'm seeking a role that helps me develop those traits.</p>
	<h3>How can you learn more about me?</h3>
