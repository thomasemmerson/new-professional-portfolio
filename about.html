	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>My name's Tom. I've worked for 8 years as a Business Analyst. I'm seeking my first User Experience (UX) role as a UX Researcher.</p>
	<h3>What do I do now?</h3>
	<p>As a Business Analyst, I have worked in the Change and IT teams of several large organisations. I analysed businesses' models, processes and systems. I developed a deep understanding of the problems facing those businesses. I then created process and system-based solutions to address those problems. Most crucially, I have extensive experience of planning and running focus groups, interviews and workshops to elicit feedback from customers and stakeholders. I have led the design process from initial ideation and problems, prototype creation and process diagramming, via early concept-modelling, to full visual design and finally producing a product backlog of fully-realised software requirements and acceptance criteria.</p>
        <h3>Why do I want to do something else?</h3>
	<p>My mission is to bridge the divide between art and technology. I want to design and build beautiful things. As a Business Analyst, I'm limited in how much creativity and divergent thinking I can use to do this. By nature I'm artistic and curious. So I feel this can only be realised if I work as a UX professional - initially as a Researcher, but hopefully in time by becoming a fully-fledged UX Designer, in a role where I can leverage my creativity.</p>
	<h3>How can you learn more about me?</h3>
