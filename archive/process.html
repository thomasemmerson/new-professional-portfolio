    <p>
Each UX project begins with the same two things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
A subject - for example a charity such as oxfam, or a company such as the Co-operative Food division.</li>
<li>
A problem - for example, the charity Oxfam isn't receiving enough donations; it doesn't see as many people volunteering to help it in the community as expected; or it's shops aren't receiving as many visitors as they initially hoped.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first and most crucial task is to establish exactly what these problems are, and to prioritise them. For example, is Oxfam more concerned about the volume of donations it receives, or the volume of volunteers? Usually these problems will require different solutions, so it is crucial to know which is most important and therefore should be prioritised to be solved first.
</p>
<p>
Second, the UX Designer's task is to understand what existing assets the client possesses to deploy in the solution. The following would all be classed as useful assets:</p>
</ul>
<li>
A website.
</li>
<li>
A native app.
</li>
<li>
A team of illustrators.
</li>
<li>
A web content management system (CMS).
</li>
<p>The next step is, of course, what most people will consider the actual 'work' of a UX design project - devising the most effective methods of meeting the customer's demands, then iterating over these methods in a repeating cycle of 'build, measure, learn'. But this will not be as effective if the initial problem has not been stated as clearly as possible.

   <h3>Introduction to Mastery, by the author Robert Greene</h3>
<p>
Recently I have been reading Mastery by Robert Greene, which is a stunning book that has affected me very deeply. He sets out the following process as being a path that anyone can follow to achieve high levels of skill, and perhaps even mastery, in any given subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>
1. Choose a life's task.
</li>
<li>
2. Submit to reality.
</li>
<li>
3. Absorb the master's power.
</li>
<li>
4. Learn how others think and behave.
</li>
<li>
5. Awaken the creative/dimensional mind.
</li>
<li>
6. Fuse the intuitive with the rational.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The next step is, of course, what most people will consider the actual 'work' of a UX design project - devising the most effective methods of meeting the customer's demands, then iterating over these methods in a repeating cycle of 'build, measure, learn'. But this will not be as effective if the initial problem has not been stated as clearly as possible.
