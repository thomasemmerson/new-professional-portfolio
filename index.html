<h3>Refreshing the Oxfam homepage</h3>
<p>
Oxfam is a confederation of numerous businesses and charities that operates throughout the developed and developing world. Its mission is to help some of the most deprived and vulnerable sections of society. As a large, multi-national organisation, Oxfam has a number of high-level business goals. It needs to curate its brand’s perception in the eyes of the public; it needs to keep driving donations in order to sustain a functioning business; and finally it needs to preserve its charity shop business, which provides a substantial amount of its annual revenue.
</p>

<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>
In modern society and the age of austerity that has dominated since 2008-2009, household budgets are shrinking year on year. This is being compounded by sustained inflation and wages that are rising at the same rate, gradually reducing take-home incomes over the long-term. In this environment, donations by the public to charities are shrinking - even amongst those with well-known and prestigious brands like Oxfam.
</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>
I was approached by a friend who works for the organisation. They asked me to review Oxfam’s existing website from a user experience (UX) perspective; identify any existing pain points or areas of friction to users; to suggest ways to improve the UX; and finally to demonstrate how these suggestions will enable users to achieve their goals more easily as well as enabling Oxfam themselves to better achieve their business goals. The most important part of the brief,therefore, is to find ways to change the user experience that customers have with Oxfam’s webpage in order to stimulate a greater level of charitable donations, and therefore secure the long-term sustainability of the charity.
</p>
<h3>Target users</h3>
<p>
From material available in the web public domain, I have found that Oxfam classify their supporters into half a dozen or so groups, including Regular giver, Single giver, Campaigner, Shop Purchaser, and Shop Gift Aider. Each of these groups represents one or more use cases that I can use to evaluate existing user journeys through the Oxfam website.
</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>
I gathered a group of users who did not have specific experience of using the website. I then asked each of them to complete certain key user tasks. During the exercise I used handwritten sheets for each of the individual “usability reports” in the survey, to document the findings of each person in raw form.
</p>
<img src="img/user-testing-sheets-landscape.jpg" alt="User Testing Sheets">


<p>
Following these usability sessions, I then interviewed the participants to collect their ideas on how to make the website more appealing and make it easier for users to achieve their goals.
</p>
<p>
To help participants better formulate their ideas, I asked them to record them in written form. Secondly to encourage their creativity, I asked participants to convey their ideas using images, and also use the “rose, thorn, bud” format to elicit positive feedback, negative feedback and suggestions on which aspects of the idea possessed the most future potential.
</p>

<img src="img/thebigidea-capture_email_land.jpg" alt="Idea Capture Forms">
<p>
Using this method, I was able to elicit  a large volume of divergent ideas and suggestions. This was entirely preferable  to producing a limited number  of suggestions myself, because there was no chance of my individual creativity  matching that of a large number of people. I then used these ideas as the basis for new webpage designs.
</p>
<h3>Common findings</h3>
<p>
After reviewing all of the feedback from these sessions, I found that all of the comments could be grouped into a number of thematic areas:
</p>
<ol>
<ul>Contextual choices</ul>
<ul>Duplication</ul>
<ul>Fields</ul>
<ul>Links</ul>
<ul>Navigation</ul>
<ul>Organisation</ul>
</ol>

<p>
As a result of conducting this user testing, there are a number of potential suggestions that could be enacted. I have organised them below by thematic area, as well as cross-referencing them alongside the user-focused KPI/s that I think they will have an impact on:
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Area / KPI</th>
    <th>KPI 1 - Average time spent on website per user session.</th> 
    <th>KPI 2 - Number of website visitors making use of a feature focused solely around Oxfam shops, such as a store locator.</th>
    <th>KPI 3 - Number of times a visitor signing up to receive email, is completed.</th>
<th>KPI 4 - Number of website users completing an online donation / Average amount per donation.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1 - contextual choices</td>
    <td>1a Do not have the ‘type of payment’ option as ‘monthly’ by default.</td>
    <td>-</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>1b Reduce the three example donation amounts presented on the single donation page.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2 - duplication</td>
    <td>-</td>
<td>-</td>
    <td>2a Remove the dropdown at the top of the page that contains duplicates of some of the links from the header.</td>
<td>-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3 - fields</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>-</td>
    <td>3a Increase the number of frequency options a user has when signing up to receive email.</td>
    <td>3b Remove several fields from the online donation pages.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
<td>4 - links</td>
<td>-<td>
<td>4a Make the shop finder panel more prominent.

4b Add another prominent link into the accented banner in the header, named “Shop in-store”.</td>
<td>4c Move certain links from the header to the footer to make others more prominent.</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5 - navigation</td>
<td>5a Simplify the links/nav structure tree around volunteering.</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6 - organisation</td>
<td>6a Consider demoting or entirely removing the option to register for an account with Oxfam.</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>6b Move the email sign-up panel to the top of the page so that it is more visible to users.</td>
<td>-</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<img src="img/sketch_landscape1.jpg" alt="New Wireframe Designs">
<p>
After designing several suggestions, I began to centre around a concept that included elements from the previous design, but improved upon it by adding emphasis and new elements that would make it easier for users to complete their goals.
</p>
<img src="img/final-wireframe.png" alt="Final Homepage Wireframe">
<p>
The final updated version of the homepage is displayed below. The following specific changes were made in response to feedback by testers, and the ideas that they generated:
A new prominent item incorporated into the header’s banner called “Shop in-store”.
No drop-down in the header, as this was confusing to users and a duplication of links available elsewhere.
The email sign-up panel is now in the header so that it is more obvious to users.
Both the email sign-up and shop finder panels in the header are far more prominent now.
The option to register for Oxfam has been moved down to the page footer, as users were confusing this with signing up to receive emails.
Some other links from the header have been moved to the footer to reduce confusion.
I have added another large, prominent ‘call to action’ button to encourage donations.

<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
The Oxfam homepage has a number of vitally important user goals. These goals are overall reasonably easy to accomplish, but when tested with a group of users that had never used the site before, it was found that several elements of the site were arranged sub-optimally. The proposed new design above, is just one single suggestion of how the site could be altered in order to hopefully improve its performance and overall usability. However - this is only one of a myriad approaches that could be adopted. I recommend that the owners of this site implement A/B, or ‘split’ testing (by sending users at random to one of several different versions of the site, and then monitoring the overall usage analytics for each different site). This will allow them to experiment with several different changes to the arrangement of page elements, and quickly establish through the use of objective data which is most effective. I also recommend that the owners of the site be prepared to frequently re-test their site with new users, as frequent customer feedback is one of the most effective ways to continually optimise a website or piece of software.
