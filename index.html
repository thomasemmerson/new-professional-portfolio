      <h3 style="clear: both; text-decoration: underline; text-align: left">Case-study - Oxfam homepage</h3>
      <p>Oxfam is a confederation of numerous businesses and charities that operates throughout the developed and developing world. Its mission is to help some of the most deprived and vulnerable sections of society. As a large, multi-national organisation, Oxfam has a number of high-level business goals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It needs to curate its brand’s perception in the eyes of the public;</li>
          <li>it needs to keep driving donations in order to sustain a functioning business;</li>
          <li>and finally it needs to preserve its charity shop business, which provides a substantial amount of its annual revenue.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>The problem</h3>
      <p>In modern society and the age of austerity that has dominated since 2008-2009, household budgets are shrinking year on year. This is being compounded by sustained inflation and wages that are rising at the same rate, gradually reducing take-home incomes over the long-term. In this environment, donations by the public to charities are shrinking - even amongst those with well-known and prestigious brands like Oxfam.</p>
      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <p>I was approached by a friend who works for the organisation. They asked me to review Oxfam’s existing 'digital' (i.e. online) presence, from a user experience (UX) perspective; identify any existing pain points or areas of friction to users; to suggest ways to improve the UX; and finally to demonstrate how these suggestions will enable users to achieve their goals more easily as well as enabling Oxfam themselves to better achieve their business goals.</p>
      <p>I produced a map to identify all the potential channels via which a customer might engage with the organisation. Of these, when I mapped them out, I found that the main website was by far the easiest and most cost-effective means of influencing customer habits and behaviour. See the below map for details.</p>
      <h3>Business goals</h3><p>Using the map, I decided the most important part of the brief is to find ways to change the user experience that customers have with Oxfam’s webpage in order to stimulate a greater level of charitable donations, and therefore secure the long-term sustainability of the charity.</p>
  <div>
  <img src="img/user_map2.png" alt="User awareness channel map">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>    
      <p>The current Oxfam homepage at the time of this study is displayed below. It is a fairly effective, responsive website (i.e. it dynamically adjusts its shape and composition dependent upon the viewport meeting specific pre-determined breakpoints). It allows customers to perform a number of tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make donations.</li>
  <li>Sign up to receive emails from Oxfam.</li>
  <li>Find the locations of Oxfam clothes shops.</li>
  <li>Find detailed information on Oxfam the charitable organisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, these are the specific user tasks that I shall focus on and use to evaluate the effectiveness of the website.
<div>
  <img src="img/as-is-homepage.png" alt="As Is Homepage">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>
I gathered a group of users who did not have specific experience of using the website. I then asked each of them to complete certain key user tasks, corresponding to the list of key tasks outlined above. During the exercise I used handwritten sheets for each of the individual “usability reports” in the survey, to document the findings of each person in raw form.
As previously mentioned, the tasks that I had them complete one at a time, without assistance, were as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make a donation of 50 pence to Oxfam (funded by me the test director.)</li>
  <li>Sign up to receive emails monthly from Oxfam.</li>
  <li>Find the full location and post code of my nearest Oxfam clothes shop.</li>
  <li>Find detailed information on the founding mission of Oxfam the charitable organisation.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<img src="img/user-testing-sheets-landscape.jpg" alt="User Testing Sheets">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<img src="img/scan333.png" alt="Actual user test sheet 1">
<p>
Following these usability sessions, I then interviewed the participants to collect their ideas on how to make the website more appealing and make it easier for users to achieve their goals.
</p>
<h3>Lessons and common findings</h3>

<p>
As a result of conducting this user testing, there are a number of potential suggestions that could be enacted.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
        In general, the header at the top of the homepage is too busy (i.e. there are too many items presented) and they are not distinct enough from one another. One user specifically suggested we remove the dropdown at the top of the page that contains duplicates of some of the links from the header, but even if we don't do this specific change, there is clearly a need for simplification.
      </li>
      <li>
        There could potentially be better links placed into the accented banner in the header, for example one named “Shop in-store” might help.
      </li>
<li>
In general, there are too many fields and inputs present across the entire page.</li>
<li>
  The shop finder panel is not prominent enough, considering how important this is.</li>
  
<li>Certain links currently in the header might benefit from being moved from their current location into the footer to make others more prominent.</li>
<li>Navigation - the links/nav structure tree around volunteering would benefit from specifically being simplified for greater effect.</li>
<li>Some testers suggested we consider demoting or entirely removing the option to register for an account with Oxfam, as it is too similar to signing up for email, but with confusingly different implications.</td>
<li>Similarly to other links, some testers suggested we move the email sign-up panel to the top of the page so that it is more visible to users.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ideation</h3>
<p>
To help participants better formulate their ideas, I asked them to record them in written form. Secondly to encourage their creativity, I asked participants to convey their ideas using images, and also use the “rose, thorn, bud” format to elicit positive feedback, negative feedback and suggestions on which aspects of the idea possessed the most future potential.
</p>
<div>
<img src="img/scan2.png" alt="Actual user suggestion sheet">
<img src="img/thebigidea-capture_email_land.jpg" alt="Idea Capture Forms">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
Using this method, I was able to elicit  a large volume of divergent ideas and suggestions. This was entirely preferable  to producing a limited number  of suggestions myself, because there was no chance of my individual creativity  matching that of a large number of people. I then used these ideas as the basis for new webpage designs.
</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>The solution that emerged during the ideation stage, was that the key customer goals identified above should be accentuated, and emphasised to appear as prominently as possible.</p>
<p>There are currently on the website too many options and calls to action, with the end result that a user's focus is diffused between all of them.</p>
<p>Therefore the theme of any new design will be too reduce the number of CTAs and to accentuate them as much as possible.</p>
<div>
  <img src="img/mobile_web.png" alt="New Wireframe Designs">
  During this stage, I created designs for a variety of viewport sizes. In these two illustrations I planned how the site would display differently on a mobile phone viewport (above) and a desktop computer/laptop viewport(below).
<img src="img/friday1.png" alt="New Wireframe Designs">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
After designing several suggestions, I began to centre around a concept that included elements from the previous design, but improved upon it by adding emphasis and new elements that would make it easier for users to complete their goals.
</p>
<div>
<p>
The final updated version of the homepage is displayed below. The following specific changes were made in response to feedback by testers, and the ideas that they generated:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>1A. A new prominent item incorporated into the header’s banner called “Shop in-store”.
  </li>
<li>1B. No drop-down in the header, as this was confusing to users and a duplication of links available elsewhere.</li>
<li>3. The email sign-up panel is now in the header so that it is more obvious to users.</li>
<li>
4. Both the email sign-up and shop finder panels in the header are far more prominent now.
</li>
<li>
5. The option to register for Oxfam has been moved down to the page footer, as users were confusing this with signing up to receive emails.</li>
<li>
6. Some other links from the header have been moved to the footer to reduce confusion.
</li>
<li>
7. I have added another large, prominent ‘call to action’ button to encourage donations.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
The Oxfam homepage has a number of vitally important user goals. These goals are overall reasonably easy to accomplish, but when tested with a group of users that had never used the site before, it was found that several elements of the site were arranged sub-optimally. The proposed new design above, is just one single suggestion of how the site could be altered in order to hopefully improve its performance and overall usability.</p><p>Following these design changes, I carried out more usability testing with new users, and found that the relative rate of success for the actions set out above was considerably more as a result.</p><p>However - this is only one of a myriad approaches that could be adopted. I recommend that the owners of this site implement A/B, or ‘split’ testing (by sending users at random to one of several different versions of the site, and then monitoring the overall usage analytics for each different site). This will allow them to experiment with several different changes to the arrangement of page elements, and quickly establish through the use of objective data which is most effective. I also recommend that the owners of the site be prepared to frequently re-test their site with new users, as frequent customer feedback is one of the most effective ways to continually optimise a website or piece of software.

<div id="Co-op">
<h3 style="text-align: left; text-decoration: underline">Case-study - The Co-operative Food</h3>
<p>
In this case study, I will recount the work I was involved in when I worked for the Co-operative Group several years ago.
</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>
The Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) has been in existence since 1863, and celebrated its 150-year anniversary in 2013. Throughout this period, the society has sought to operate in an ethical and sustainable fashion. Whilst this has meant the business has grown consistently and reliably, it has also lagged behind new developments in technology and supply chain efficiency as a result.
</p>
<p>
In the last decade, the Co-operative Group was formed to preside over the Co-operative portfolio of companies - a group including a food division, legal, insurance, electrical goods, and travel amongst others. Whilst operational and day-to-day business decisions remain with each business unit, the Group handles areas where decisions can be made collectively on behalf of all the units (such as procurement, strategy and branding). Whilst this reorganisation has allowed the Co-operative Group to centralise much of its decision-making, it has also rendered much of the organisation too conservative, stagnant and unwilling to keep up-to-date with the latest developments in technology. This has had a knock-on effect on its ability to effectively market to customers, and this in turn has negatively impacted its share of the food retail market.
</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>
In 2013 I was part of a Digital IT team operating within this executive unit of the Co-operative Group. We were enlisted by the Co-operative Food business unit to design a new digital artefact for customers to use. It was decided it should take the form of a responsive web app and a native iOS and Android app. All artefacts, it was decided, should employ user experience principles and methods to meet the needs of our business stakeholders.
 </p>
<h3>Business goals</h3>
<p>
Firstly I examined what I felt were the overall business goals the Co-operative Food possessed:
</p>
<p>
Firstly, brand reputation has a huge impact on any supermarket chain’s profitability; therefore Co-operative Food has to invest a lot of time and capital in its brand image amongst the public. It is continually seeking to promote its brand and ethical values.</p>
<p>
Second, it needs to aggressively drive public footfall into its food shops. The UK food retail industry is crowded and competitive. This has intensified in the last five years as discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl have disrupted the 'big four' (Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrison's) by providing a comparable level of quality but at far lower cost. Co-operative Food's position in the market is somewhere behind Morrison's, so the rise of the discounters is particularly troubling. One advantage to the Group is that it has arguably the highest area coverage across the UK of any food retailer; it allegedly has a shop in every single postal code area.
</p>
<p>
Thirdly, the Co-operative Group has historically been slow in its adoption of new technology and process improvement practices. Platforms such as social media, big data/analytics, native phone apps, and mobile websites are all areas that other retailers have enthusiastically engaged with; so far, Co-op has failed to do this. This is due in part to the company's refusal to abandon the stereotype of its typical customer base of older, more conventional customers who struggle to understand or engage with technology. Other businesses are rapidly showing this assumption to be false, so the Co-op needs to rush to adopt digital platforms or it will begin to fall even further behind its competitors.
</p>
<p>
Now that we have established a number of Co-operative Food’s high-level business goals, how can we translate these into measurements that we can use to assess potential performance of a new app?
 </p>
<p>
If we wanted to focus solely on the website (as this is the main focus of this study) then we need to decide what sort of behaviours we are seeking to encourage in people who visit the site. For example – do we just want to encourage people to spend as much time on the site as possible? Do we want them to complete certain very specific actions?
</p>
<p>
I have repeated this process of analysis with each of the goals above, providing several key performance indicators (KPIs) for each:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Improve brand awareness:
      <ul>
        <li>Average time spent on website per user.</li>
        <li>Average number of page-views per unique session.</li>
        <li>Bounce rate (percentage of users who leave a site without interacting with the first page they landed on).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Increase number of visitors to shops:
      <ul>
        <li>Number of website users enquiring about an Co-op Food shop.</li>
        <li>Customer satisfaction surveys.</li>
        <li>Number of online check-ins at a shop.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
       <li>
          Adopt new technology:
          <ul>
            <li>Proportion of revenue derived from new initiatives.</li>
            <li>Rate of adoption of new platforms by users.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
  </ul>
<p>
After considering the business objectives in detail and how to measure them, we must also remember that the users’ objectives will not always be the same. Our primary concern as an organisation may be the achievement of our business objectives, but as a UX practitioner, if we fail to make it easy for users to achieve their specific goals, our business will suffer as a result.
</p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<div>
<img src="img/New-branding-Coop-Food-High-St-Manchester2.jpg" alt="Picture from Co-op Food store 1">
  <p>I visited several Co-operative Food physical store locations in order to better understand the user journey that customers experienced, following their visit to the website.
  </p>
<img src="img/dc-12-of-21.jpg" alt="Picture from Co-op Food store 2">
  <p>I paid particular attention to what sort of products were located at various areas of the stores, and what sort of order customers prefer to access areas in.
  </p>
<img src="img/floorplan.png" alt="Floorplan sketch from Co-op Food store">
  <p>Finally, I also paid close attention to wthe store lay-out: what items were arranged where; what was close to or far away from what; what other features/amenities were present in the store; and finally what effect were all of these features intended to have on visiting shoppers.
  </p>  
<img src="img/hello-fresh-recipe-card-720x540.jpg" alt="Picture of HelloFresh recipes card">
<p>As part of my research, I also examined recipe services such as HelloFresh which employ convenience to offer matter-of-fact cooking instructions, but combined with indulgent, "food porn"-style photos to give the average customer inspiration.
</div>
<img src="img/Screen Shot 2018-01-03 at 08.19.10.png" alt="Good Food Magazine recent covers">
<p>I reviewed several different 'foodie' magazines, as these offer a combination of attractive ingredients and deals, alongside quick and convenient recipes.</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>
At numerous intervals during the product’s development, my team and I held user feedback sessions with members of staff and the public. We employed various methods to enlist random strangers; these included stopping employees on their way into work in the Co-operative Group’s head office, and asking them to use and evaluate the prototype product (they were compensated for their time with a free coffee voucher!)
</p>
<p>
The testing aimed to answer several questions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
How easy is it for users to achieve certain tasks?</li>
<li>
How does the app compare to the performance of other apps?</li>
<li>
What would you change?</li>
<li>
What additional features would you want the app to have?
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Design Suggestion</h3>
<p>
The user testing I did was extremely valuable, and produced several valuable lessons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users liked the idea of seeing recipes that used ingredients that were available in Co-op Food stores, and wanted this feature to be promoted to be more visible in the product.</li>
  <li>Users wanted to interact with the contents of the product - namely the deals and recipes. Several suggested a mechanism for 'liking' the content, like one might do on Facebook or other social apps.</li>
  <li>One of the features users liked the most, was the rich imagery showing several products - like the existing paper-based Co-op Food magazine, this is a great opportunity for the business to promote its best assets - its quality produce.</li>
</ul>
<p>These findings led me to several important conclusions about users' goals and desires when using such a product.
<p>
<p>Based on these conclusions, I then began to sketch out ideas for a customer journey within a mobile phone app. These initial sketches and ideas can be seen below.
</p>
<div>
<img src="img/landscape1.jpg" alt="Hand-sketched design for the new app number 1">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<div>
<img src="img/landscape2.jpg" alt="Hand-sketched design for the new app number 2">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
Based on the above findings, I have produced visual designs for the Co-operative Food’s native app. The user journey begins with a splash screen that they see when they first open the native app, having downloaded it from the Apple/Google Play Store.
</p>
<div>
<img src="img/screenshot1.png" alt="Set 1 photoshop designs for the new app">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
Once inside the app, they are greeted by a landing page that promotes several current in-store deals, but also has a 'hero' banner promoting specific recipes that can be made using ingredients on sale in Co-operative Food stores.
</p>
<div>
<img src="img/screenshot2.png" alt="Set 2 photoshop designs for the new app">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
The alternative 'hero' banner in the designs is based around a specific seasonal event: in the design shown here, it is promoting Valentine's Day. Clicking on this element will take the user to a new screen containing specific deals related to that seasonal event.
</p>
<div>
<img src="img/screenshot3.png" alt="Set 3 photoshop designs for the new app">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
The app also gives users the ability to sign up/sign in. Signing in gives them access to several more advanced features - in this example, the ability to either create a shopping list of items, or to mark specific deals as "Favourites". Each deal has a small call to action (CTA) resembling a star next to it, which allows signed in users to add it to their list of favourites. If the user clicks the star CTA without first signing in, then they are prompted to do so.
</p>
<div>
<img src="img/screenshot4.png" alt="Set 4 photoshop designs for the new app">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
The main change features of the new design are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Specific 'hero' banners that are designed to prominently display specific items, so that they are given maximum visibility and attention by webpage users.</li>
  <li>Purpose-built pages that are linked to from the 'hero' banners, where viewers can find out more information about these deals.</li>
  <li>The ability to 'like' specific items (one possible way to do this is via the use of a "star" call-to-action), which adds items to a special 'shopping list' that viewers can review later on at their leisure.</li>
<li>The ability to 'like' items and add them to a private list, necessitates the ability to sign up/sign in using a username/email address and password.</li>
<li>Specific and detail-rich pages giving complex recipes, involving dishes that can be made using ingredients that are exclusively available at Co-operative Food stores.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also, I produced a clickable prototype using these designs, which can be accessed at MarvelApp using the following
<a style="color: blue" href="https://marvelapp.com/1719139">link</a>.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Co-operative Food division is a retail brand with several unique and strong advantages. It has an extremely well-established and unique reputation as an ethical retailer, and a purveyor of quality products. It offers extremely convenient shop locations, with over 2,500 locations in the United Kingdom alone.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the best way for the Co-operative to achieve its objectives of increased revenue and profitability is simply to emphasise these strengths as much as possible via its digital channels. This is something the Co-operative has failed to do in the past - it has focused on traditional, well-established supply chains and has neglected developing channels such as mobile and web. This needs to change if the Co-operative Food business is to survive and thrive.</p>
<p>As part of this project, I have designed responsive webpages that accentuate the quality and availability of the Co-operative's products. It also showcases them in the context of various seasonal deals, such as Christmas and Valentine's Day.</p>
<p>If I were to expand further on this project, my next step would potentially be to further accentuate the convenience and availability of the Co-operative Food branches. Perhaps I could do this by adding a prominent, easy-to-access store locator feature that used Google Maps or similar technology to showcase just how closeby each Co-op Food store was.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the designs here represent just the first step in the Co-operative Food's journey to embrace digital media.<p>
