									<p>Between 2015 and 2017 I worked for HRonline, which provided cloud-based HR management software for a large base of companies. HRonline began life as an in-house product designed and built by the parent company, Peninsula Business Services. Originally, HRonline was just used by PBS to keep track of its own workforce, but eventually the managers realised that as a free-standing product, they could lease it to clients as part of a package of services. These client companies ranged from small, self-employed groups of tradesmen with less than 10 employees, to large enterprises with several thousand. Each of these companies had very different requirements for their HR software.</p>
									<p>After initially enjoying an enthusiastic reception to the launch of HRonline, and developing a specific set of features, Peninsula began building a successor product called BrightHR, which was tailored toward a significantly smaller and more defined audience - companies with between 50 to 250 employees.</p>

									<p>When BrightHR was created and developed, an entirely new team of UX Designers and Developers was recruited to lead and participate in its creation. However, during the same period, HRonline continued to be sold and maintained, and serviced approximately 8,000 clients.</p>
									<p>During this period, because the main UX team was solely focused on developing BrightHR, I was expected to lead the UX design and requirements analysis for HRonline. This involved leading a team of designers and developers to ascertain what improvements and additional features would prove the most helpful and effective for our diverse range of clients.</p>
									<p>Throughout this period, these clients continued to expect new features and functionality to be developed at the same pace as before. It was therefore necessary to carry out research, idea generation and testing, drawing together customer feedback, ideas and requests, and from the ensuing list derive a backlog of changes that would prove most effective if made to the product.</p>

									<p>Once I had been assigned sole responsibility for HRonline, it became clear the objective of this project was to enhance the product with extra features that would dramatically improve the users' experience, increase the rate of usage of the product, and make its renewal more attractive to its customers, many of whom also had a range of services purchased through Peninsula as well as HRonline.</p>
									<p>To do this, my team and l followed a holistic UX approach, beginning with problem definition, before progressing into broad research and finally conducting a design sprint with the intention to ‘build-measure-learn’.</p>
									<p>The output of the entire project process was an agreed set of documentation for development - taking the form of high-fidelity visual designs, accompanied by detailed written requirements. By the point that these were produced, they had been through an iterative process which had seen them validated several times as lower-fidelity prototypes and mockups.</p>

									<p>As stated above, my team and I wanted to add new features in order to make the product more attractive to its users. We decided that we would employ a number of business key performance indicators to measure this. Specifically, we agreed we would measure the following:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											Firstly, retention rate which would be measured by:
											<ul>
												<li>
													Number of clients retained month to month.
												</li>
												<li>
													Number of clients a month versus the same month of the previous year.
												</li>
												<li>
													Number of users retained via the same measures.
												</li>
												<li>
													Financial amount of revenue retained using the same measures.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											Secondly, general rates of usage, which would include metrics such as:
											<ul>
												<li>
													Number of unique users from week to week.
												</li>
												<li>
													Number of unique users in a week, versus the same week of the previous year.
												</li>
												<li>
													Average time spent logged in per session, per user.
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>The software allowed the development team to effectively decouple deployment to the live environment, and releasing a feature to clients. Therefore once a feature had been deployed, using so-called 'feature switches’ the development team was able to manually 'toggle on’ this feature for only a select list of clients.</p>
									<p>This approach allowed the design team to design a feature, have it developed and deployed by our technical team - but to a limited audience - and then compare specific metrics for that group to a so-called 'control group’ that had not received the feature. This allowed us to scientifically measure the impact of our designs on the client-base.</p>
									<p>In terms of what specific features should be developed, the business stakeholders suggested that one feature in particular that they believed would be valuable to clients was an in-built task management feature, that was similar to existing apps such as Wrike or Asana. Accordingly, I decided to plan and conduct my research with particular emphasis placed upon discussing and validating whether a feature of this nature would be valuable.</p>

<p>Before making any changes to the HRonline product, first I needed to carry out research into the client-base and the proposed features. My research took several forms accordingly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Firstly, I interviewed a number of clients in order to achieve several objectives: firstly, to establish demographic and other data about them; secondly, to validate what features they would like to see added to the web product, and finally, as discussed above, to specifically validate whether a task management feature would be of value.</li>

<li>Secondly, I carried out personal research into the current market for task management products and apps.</li>

<li>Finally, I was able to secure an interview in person, with the HR manager working for the parent company.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Research 1 - interviews</h4>

<p>My method for doing this was to conduct a number of interviews with users with the permissions level of account administrator, who I know (using data from the HRonline SQL Server database) have used the version of the tasks feature that still existed in the historical “version 1” (legacy) section of the product. Each interview took approximately 20 minutes, and consisted of me asking the users the list of questions that follow.</p>

<p>Also, as well as guiding any subsequent designs or changes, I hoped that interviewing these customers would allow me to add more details to several customer personas that I had already created to guide my designs and inform my decision-making. These personas can be found further on in this report.</p>

<p>Here is the standard question format that I used for these interviews:
</p>

<p>General feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell me about yourself:</li>
<ol>
<li>Name.</li>
<li>Company reference.</li>
<li>Age bracket (i.e. 16-23, 24-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61 upwards).</li>
<li>Length of experience with the company.</li>
<li>Duties.</li>
<li>Number of reports if any.</li>
</ol>
<li>Tell me about your company?</li>
<li>What do you use HRonline for?</li>
<li>How do you find it?</li>
<li>What could be better?</li>
</ul>

<p>Specific task management feedback:</p>
<ol>
<li>What tasks do you still complete using the HRonline dashboard?</li>
<li>What tasks do you perform most often in your role?</li>
<li>What tasks do other people perform that you would like to manage?</li>
<li>How would you use a task manager feature if it were available to you?</li>
<li>What could HRonline do, to make it easier for you to use the new HRonline dashboard rather than the legacy product?</li>
</ol>

<img src="img\questionnaire_3.jpg" alt="Hand-printed questionnaire 3 of 4">
<img src="img\questionnaire_4.jpg" alt="Hand-printed questionnaire 4 of 4">
<p>The above pictures show some examples of the surveys that I transcribed during the interviews with clients.</p>

<h4>Research 2 - reviewing existing apps and products</h4>

<p>To carry out research on existing task management apps and products, I spent some time looking at current products using a search engine, and comparing their relative features. I also read several articles (mainly on sites such as Lifehacker and Zapier), which already existed with the main purpose of reviewing and comparing task manager tools.</p>

<p>My research led me to draw several conclusions.</p>

<p>Firstly, the existing task manager product category is extremely saturated - there are literally thousands of tools performing this role available through the Apple app store, and as many more available through the broader internet. This leads me to conclude that any new task manager app or feature that I design, is extremely unlikely to create new functionality that has not already been thought of. Instead, the main benefit of a task manager feature within HRonline, is its integration with the rest of the product. For example, when a new employee is added to the system upon joining a company, a task manager feature might automatically create and assign a task to that employee’s manager, to perform their probation review after an initial period of three months.</p>

<p>Secondly, the existing pool of task management products can be broadly divided into several categories. These roughly appear as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grocery List apps for simple task lists.</li>
<li>“Getting Things Done (GTD)” apps for detailed task lists, projects and enabling the user to assess, prioritise and then action items.</li>
<li>Kanban Board apps to visualize tasks as they flow through a series of stages.</li>
<li>Plain Text apps to manage tasks that are created on a free-form basis.</li>
<li>Other options when nothing else works that don’t fall into the above categories.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each of these categories caters to slightly different audiences, each of whom have different user goals. Therefore, it is essential that I consider carefully which of these categories I need any new feature to fall into for my existing pool of users.</p>

<p>As a result of this research, which was carried out during the period when I was also conducting interview questionnaires with clients, I added the following question to the script:</p>

<p><i>“If you believe you would use a task management feature if it were made available in HRonline, which of the following descriptions best describes the way that you would use it? (Include the above list of 5 types of to-do list apps.)”</i></p>

<p>Finally, I concluded that many of the task management products available were free. This meant that it would be difficult to use the addition of such a feature to HRonline, as a justification for a price increase, or as a unique selling point that in itself provides enough justification for retaining the entire product. I realised that if we were to proceed in developing a task management feature, then I would need to be conscious of the fact that the feature could only be a single positive point in a set of features that would need to co-exist with one another.</p>

<img src="img\task_research_1.png" alt="Screenshots of the research that I did into task tools - picture 1">
<p>Wrike is a popular task-management product with project management professionals.</p>
<img src="img\task_research_3.png" alt="Screenshots of the research that I did into task tools - picture 3"><p>Asana is another popular task-management product with project management professionals.</p>
<img src="img\task_research_2.png" alt="Screenshots of the research that I did into task tools - picture 2"><p>I researched the state of the task management app marketplace comprehensively, and in doing so uncovered a number of types of apps that can be classified separately (see below).</p>


<h4>Research 3 - walking through current processes with in-house HR manager</h4>

<p>In the final strand of my research, I carried out a more in-depth analysis of a client's HR requirements - with the HR manager of Peninsula, the parent company of HRonline.</p>

<p>By doing this interview in person, I was able not only to ask more detailed, qualitative questions of the respondent, but I could break down her answers into more detailed, step-by-step processes.</p>

<img src="img\Customer_Journeys.jpg" alt="Post-it notes from in-depth client interview">
<p>The blue post-it notes were used to separate the different roles/classes of user that were required by the administrator of the scheme. Pink post-it notes indicated high-level user goals, also referred to as "epics". Finally, the yellow post-it notes were used to break out and capture slightly more granular user objectives, also referred to as "features".</p>
<img src="img\tom122.png" alt="Process map of qualification creation and update">
  <p>The above process details what currently happens for a lot of clients, when an employee needs to regularly complete and then maintain a qualification, for example training relating to compliance with a particular law or set of standards. Many HRonline clients that operate in the health and social care industries fall into this category.</p>
  <h3>Testing</h3>
<p>Following the research and interview phase, I decided to test out certain features by observing participants as they used a clickable prototype.</p>

<p>My interviews with multiple users from multiple existing clients has suggested that many would indeed receive well the addition of a task manager feature in the product. Because of this, I decided to rapid-prototype a low-fidelity mockup of how such a feature may appear, and behave.</p>

<p>“Lean startup” methodology encourages the use of what is known as a “minimum viable product”, or an “MVP”; this is essentially an experiment designed to validate an hypothesis.</p>

<p>In this case, the hypothesis - which the lean startup would refer to as the “value hypothesis” - states simply that clients would find the feature valuable enough to buy the product, or in this case continue using it. An MVP is a product or deliverable that is deliberately designed to gather information by expending as little time, resource and money as possible. In this case, designing an extremely low-fidelity prototype reusing existing screens from the web product seemed like an excellent way to do this.</p>

<p>Therefore, in order to construct this prototype, and especially to do so using as little time, resource and money as is necessary, I created hand-drawn sketches of how I envisaged the feature would look - similar to the effect that would have been created if I had used a tool such as Balsamiq - scanned them electronically, and then linked them together in a so-called 'clickable prototype'. (I could have used one of several tools for this task, including InVision, Pop or Marvel; I chose to use Marvel out of personal preference.) Once this was complete, I essentially had a working prototype of a new, as-yet undeveloped task manager feature, that I could test out with interviewees. Because it was clickable, when the user clicked on various sections of each page, the prototype would respond accordingly just like a finished product would.</p>

<p>Creating and then showing people an “MVP” in this manner was a great way to quickly and cheaply test and validate assumptions that I was making about a product feature.</p>

<h4>Task management feature - validation</h4>
<p>Firstly, a large portion of my survey respondents indicated that a task management function would in fact be useful to them, and to their staff.</p>

<p>Secondly, common areas that respondents indicated would be helped by managing using tasks, included the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initial probation reviews and ongoing annual/semi-annual appraisals for new starters.</li>
<li>Regular ‘one to ones’ between staff and their line managers.</li>
<li>The performing of vocational training and the achievement/maintenance of job-related qualifications by staff in a number of industries, including health and social care, education and administration.</li>
</ol>
<p>Further, many respondents who replied positively about the possibility of a task management feature, also liked the idea of being able to run reports and keep track of task completion in a formal, organised way. Therefore, I concluded that reporting on tasks would be another valuable feature to prototype.</p>
<p>In addition, another feature that respondents seemed to indicate would be welcome, was the ability to assign tasks to specified individuals - often different people to the person that had originally created the task. This would allow, for example, an administrator to assign tasks to team managers to do 1:1s with each of their team. Furthermore, respondents also suggested that tasks should have optional 'subjects': for example, if a team manager is assigned a task to interview a team member, then that team member would be the subject of the task.</p>

<p>Finally, many respondents alluded to the desire to create some sort of integrated workflow within the HRonline web software. A key example of this sort of workflow was mentioned earlier: for example, when a new employee is added to the system upon joining a company, a task manager feature might automatically create and assign a task to that employee’s manager, to perform their probation review after an initial period of three months. Many of the respondents indicated that this sort of seamless integration would be welcomed. Perhaps the biggest single benefit of such integration, it seemed, would be allowing administrators and managers to reduce their cognitive load whilst using the product (i.e. by recording tasks they needed to perform later, so they didn't have to carry them in their short-term memory).</p>
<h4>Customer personas</h4>

<p>Before attempting to make any recommendations about how to structure a new HR app, I decided that I needed to build up a clearer picture of the clients/customers I would be trying to serve with the changes. As a result of this conclusion, another successful outcome of my client research was that I was able to use the information I obtained to compose several Customer Personas. A persona of this nature is a fictional but archetypal identity representing what my research suggested were typical users of my potential product feature.</p>

<p>The key findings from the creation of these personas are presented below:</p>

<h5>Customer persona 1 - Payroll Manager 'Penny'</h5>
<img src="img\persona_1-1.png" alt="Customer persona 1 page number 1">
<img src="img\persona_1-2.png" alt="Customer persona 1 page number 1">
<img src="img\persona_1-3.png" alt="Customer persona 1 page number 3">
<img src="img\persona_1-4.png" alt="Customer persona 1 page number 4">
<p>Having constructed this customer persona, I also needed to confirm which category of task manager tool, mentioned earlier on in my research, would the persona be suited for? I decided that this persona would fit the closest with either the “Getting Things Done (GTD)” style app for detailed task lists; or, a plain text app that would let a user create and manage free-form texts.</p>
<h5>Customer persona 2 - Office Manager 'Sally'</h5>
<img src="img\persona_2-1.png" alt="Customer persona 2 page number 1">
<img src="img\persona_2-2.png" alt="Customer persona 2 page number 1">
<img src="img\persona_2-3.png" alt="Customer persona 2 page number 3">
<img src="img\persona_2-4.png" alt="Customer persona 2 page number 4">
<p>I decided that the same assessment that I recorded for customer persona 1 would also apply to persona 2; i.e. either the “Getting Things Done (GTD)” style app for detailed task lists; or, a plain text app would be most suitable.</p>

<p>I decided that the best way to launch a simple version of a task management feature would be to make it as simple as possible, whilst simultaneously giving users of the feature as much control as possible.</p>

<p>This meant designing the initial version to be as quick and intuitive to use as possible. This was done using a number of design decisions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Firstly, the first version of the feature would have no “delete” functionality: once a task was created by a user, the only way to deal with it, other than by marking it as “complete”, would be by editing its description text.</li>
  <li>Secondly, by making the description text entirely editable by the user, I ensured that users could make tasks be about absolutely anything at all; therefore giving them the maximum amount of control over the feature. By utilising free text descriptions, tasks could literally be about anything, or be edited to become about literally anything else.</li><li>Also, in addition to this, the first version of the feature included multiple calls to action (CTAs) for the user to send us feedback through a number of methods. We included a URL that would open an extra browser window at a purpose-built SurveyMonkey questionnaire, and we included custom Google Analytics event tags on each of the main buttons on the page, so that we could record exactly how many times each of the buttons was being clicked on and when.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several advantages of launching a simplified version of the feature.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Firstly, the speed at which the feature can be deployed is far greater the fewer functions it allows.</li>
  <li>Secondly, the less functions the initial product has, the more that users’ feedback can be focused accurately.</li>
<li>Finally, if the research and testing done so far that suggested this feature would be popular proves to be wrong, and the feature is abandoned by users, the smaller the amount of time, money and resource that has been spent in order to discover this the better.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point in the project I decided that it would be a good idea to carry out a brainstorming session. The purpose of this session was to think divergently about possible features for the task management page and to record them all before potentially testing with account clients. The list of brainstormed items that were initially created before being reviewed, was as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Auto-suggesting the creation of new tasks: as mentioned earlier, when a new employee is added to the client's roster, could the task manager feature automatically create a task; make the new employee the subject; assign it to the employee's manager and auto-populate it with the instructions to carry out a probation review after the employee's first three months of employment.</li>
  <li>Manipulating tasks should be intuitive; therefore, it should be really easy for users to create new tasks or edit existing ones.</li>
  <li>To this end - what if the user could easily click a button to 'clone' a new task from an existing one?</li>
  <li>The user should be able to move tasks around intuitively - i.e. by dragging, dropping, or other easy and simple user interface actions.</li>
  <li>Filter task lists, for example by the assignee - so that, if I am an administrator, I can see at a glance all the tasks just assigned to one of my direct reports.</li>
  <li>The ability to create tasks spontaneously, wherever I am in the product - for example, I may be in another section entirely, but I want to add a task at the exactg
    point it occurs to me, not later on.</li>
  <li>The ability to link tasks with one another? For example, to create a task that is a 'child' task of another?</li>
  <li>Custom fields - what if I want each of my tasks to hold an item of data that doesn't fit with any of the existing fields belonging to the task.</li>
  <The ability to add check-lists to tasks, to allow the user to tick off a range of specific actions/tasks.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Having concluded my research, and having drawn several conclusions from the work, I now set about brainstorming a range of user interface solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>The new task manager feature needs to visually and aesthetically fit with the rest of the project, even though it is a new feature.</li>
<li>The feature needs to be responsive, as the rest of the product is (i.e. it needs to adapt appropriately to different-sized viewports, devices and browsers).</li>
<li>Any task management feature needs to be intuitive to use. The entire purpose of the new feature is to save users time and effort; therefore, it must behave effortlessly and anticipate their most common intentions.</li>
<li>The new feature needs to take advantage of the existing analytics package in use throughout the rest of the product (at the time of writing, Google Analytics). This is in order to track time spent on each page and the number of keystrokes committed by each user, so that the feature can be improved iteratively.</li>

<p>As stated above, the "lean startup" methodology encourages the use of a so-called "minimum viable product", or MVP, which is an experiment designed to prove or disprove an assertion for the smallest investment of time, money and resources. Having created a set of wireframes and tested them with early users, I chose to continue this approach by selecting a sub-set of requirements and building these into a first release.</p><p>The intention was that a secondary release would follow soon after, and that this would build on the lessons learnt from customer feedback on the first release. By dividing the requirements into several releases, instead of building a fully-functional, all-encompassing solution and launching it in one, I enabled the development team to build and release the first iteration quickly, and kept the focus of the trial narrow so as to allow feedback to be more directed and targeted.<p>
<p>The requirements for the first version of the task management feature contained the following main features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ability to create new tasks.</li>
  <li>The first version of the feature would have no “delete” functionality: once a task was created by a user, the only way to deal with it, other than by marking it as “complete”, would be by editing its description text.</li>
  <li>The ability to edit all available fields belonging to each task, which comprised the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Date due</li>
      <li>Description</li>
      <li>Title</li>
      <li>Creator</li>
      <li>Subject</li>
      <li>Assignee</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The ability via multiple calls to action (CTAs) for the user to send us feedback through a number of methods, including a purpose-built SurveyMonkey questionnaire, and custom Google Analytics event tags on each of the main buttons on the page.</li>
    <li>The ability to sort tasks by any of the fields described above.</li>
    <li>The ability to filter the tasks shown on any of the above fields.</li>
</ul>

<p>As described above, once I had agreed upon these requirements, I then produced a set of high-fidelity designs using Adobe Creative Cloud (specifically Adobe Photoshop). These designs are shown below.</p>

<img src="img\task_prototype_1.png" alt="Task management prototype screen number 1">
<p>The first image (above) is the so-called 'empty state' screen, when the user would access the screen that will eventually contain the tasks, but for the very first time. Right now, it feels and looks very unwelcome and sparse. My initial feedback, were I to be used as a tester, would be to add content to this page - perhaps an illustration or animation to make it seem interesting and encourage users to engage with it.</p>
<img src="img\task_prototype_2.png" alt="Task management prototype screen number 2">
<p>The second image - which is above - is witnessed when the user now engages with the page and attempts to enter their first task from this screen. However - there is the separate possibility that a task may have been pre-added via a pre-existing workflow.</p><p>From this screen, the user is able to create, read and update task items. They can also add specific details to the tasks. They can assign tasks to a different individual, so that they delegate responsibility for performing the task to someone else.</p>

<img src="img\task_prototype_3.png" alt="Task management prototype screen number 3">
<p>The third image - above - is a detailed summary list of all the tasks that have been created so far.</p>
<img src="img\task_prototype_4.png" alt="Task management prototype screen number 4">
<p>The fourth image - above - is when a user marks a task as 'complete', at which point it disappears.</p>
<img src="img\task_prototype_5.png" alt="Task management prototype screen number 5">
<p>The fifth and final image - above - is when a user creates an initial ticket, and can specify a great deal of details about it and the information contained within it.</p>

<p>As an aside - during the creation of the high-fidelity designs, it became clear to me that it would greatly benefit me to be able to quickly refer to a range of design standards and templates. To this end, I created a relatively small, single-page brand asset style guide.</p>
<img src="img\HRonline_Brand_Guidlines.png" alt="HRonline brand and style-guide">
<p>I tried to keep the style guide clean and simple, but yet at the same time be comprehensive enough that it would prove to be extremely useful whenever I subsequently needed to create or assemble more visual assets for this product or its new features.</p>

<p>As stated above, the first release and the features specified within it, were only the first of several planned iterations. The advantage of frequent, smaller releases is far greater flexibility and the opportunity to benefit from earlier and more regularly-occurring feedback points.</p>
<p>After the first release of the task management feature - which was only released to a sub-set of clients - as discussed earlier, we monitored several key performance indicators for both that group and for a so-called 'control group' of clients that had <i>not</i> received the new feature.</p>
<p>What we observed was that after launch, the task manager feature experienced a great deal of immediate attention and usage from those clients. This was encouraging: it meant that those clients were interested in the feature, and this further corroborated our earlier research suggesting that a feature of this nature would fit in well and be enthusiastically received.</p>
<p>However, after a month or so, we realised that it was more difficult to track whether there had been a statistically relevant difference in retention rate between the clients receiving the feature and the control group. We <i>did</i> however observe that the average time spent in the product rose significantly amongst those clients with the feature compared to those without.</p>
<p>From this data, we were prepared to conclude that the addition of the task feature to a client's product <i>did</i> in fact have a net positive affect on that client's behaviour and interaction with the product.</p>
<p>Going forward from this initial release, the team were encouraged by this early success. Following this assessment, we continued to iterate on the structure and functionality within the task manager feature, and continued to use key performance indicators to assess whether those changes had a positive impact on the clients receiving the feature or not.</p>

										The Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) has been in existence since 1863, and celebrated its 150-year anniversary in 2013. Throughout this period, the society has sought to operate in an ethical and sustainable fashion. Whilst this has meant the business has grown consistently and reliably, it has also lagged behind new developments in technology and supply chain efficiency as a result.
									</p>
									<p>
										In the last decade, the Co-operative Group was formed to preside over the Co-operative portfolio of companies - a group including a food division, legal, insurance, electrical goods, and travel amongst others. Whilst operational and day-to-day business decisions remain with each business unit, the Group handles areas where decisions can be made collectively on behalf of all the units (such as procurement, strategy and branding). Whilst this reorganisation has allowed the Co-operative Group to centralise much of its decision-making, it has also rendered much of the organisation too conservative, stagnant and unwilling to keep up-to-date with the latest developments in technology. This has had a knock-on effect on its ability to effectively market to customers, and this in turn has negatively impacted its share of the food retail market.

										In 2013 I was part of a Digital IT team operating within this executive unit of the Co-operative Group. We were enlisted by the Co-operative Food business unit to design a new digital artefact for customers to use. It was decided it should take the form of a responsive web app and a native iOS and Android app. All artefacts, it was decided, should employ user experience principles and methods to meet the needs of our business stakeholders.

							<div id="section2collapse4" class="collapse hide" aria-labelledby="section2heading4" data-parent="#accordion" style="">
								<div class="card-body">
<p>
Firstly I examined what I felt were the overall business goals the Co-operative Food possessed:
</p>
<p>
Firstly, brand reputation has a huge impact on any supermarket chain’s profitability; therefore Co-operative Food has to invest a lot of time and capital in its brand image amongst the public. It is continually seeking to promote its brand and ethical values.</p>
<p>
Second, it needs to aggressively drive public footfall into its food shops. The UK food retail industry is crowded and competitive. This has intensified in the last five years as discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl have disrupted the 'big four' (Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrison's) by providing a comparable level of quality but at far lower cost. Co-operative Food's position in the market is somewhere behind Morrison's, so the rise of the discounters is particularly troubling. One advantage to the Group is that it has arguably the highest area coverage across the UK of any food retailer; it allegedly has a shop in every single postal code area.
</p>
<p>
Thirdly, the Co-operative Group has historically been slow in its adoption of new technology and process improvement practices. Platforms such as social media, big data/analytics, native phone apps, and mobile websites are all areas that other retailers have enthusiastically engaged with; so far, Co-op has failed to do this. This is due in part to the company's refusal to abandon the stereotype of its typical customer base of older, more conventional customers who struggle to understand or engage with technology. Other businesses are rapidly showing this assumption to be false, so the Co-op needs to rush to adopt digital platforms or it will begin to fall even further behind its competitors.
</p>
<p>
Now that we have established a number of Co-operative Food’s high-level business goals, how can we translate these into measurements that we can use to assess potential performance of a new app?
 </p>
<p>
If we wanted to focus solely on the website (as this is the main focus of this study) then we need to decide what sort of behaviours we are seeking to encourage in people who visit the site. For example – do we just want to encourage people to spend as much time on the site as possible? Do we want them to complete certain very specific actions?
</p>
<p>
I repeated this process of analysis with each of the goals above, providing several key performance indicators (KPIs) for each:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Improve brand awareness:
      <ul>
        <li>Average time spent on website per user.</li>
        <li>Average number of page-views per unique session.</li>
        <li>Bounce rate (percentage of users who leave a site without interacting with the first page they landed on).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Increase number of visitors to shops:
      <ul>
        <li>Number of website users enquiring about an Co-op Food shop.</li>
        <li>Customer satisfaction surveys.</li>
        <li>Number of online check-ins at a shop.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
       <li>
          Adopt new technology:
          <ul>
            <li>Proportion of revenue derived from new initiatives.</li>
            <li>Rate of adoption of new platforms by users.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
  </ul>
<p>
After considering the business objectives in detail and how to measure them, we must also remember that the users’ objectives will not always be the same. Our primary concern as an organisation may be the achievement of our business objectives, but as a UX practitioner, if we fail to make it easy for users to achieve their specific goals, our business will suffer as a result.

  <p>I visited several Co-operative Food physical store locations in order to better understand the user journey that customers experienced, following their visit to the website.
  </p>
<img src="img/dc-12-of-21.jpg" alt="Picture from Co-op Food store 2">
  <p>I paid particular attention to what sort of products were located at various areas of the stores, and what sort of order customers prefer to access areas in.
  </p>
<img src="img/floorplan.png" alt="Floorplan sketch from Co-op Food store">
  <p>Finally, I also paid close attention to wthe store lay-out: what items were arranged where; what was close to or far away from what; what other features/amenities were present in the store; and finally what effect were all of these features intended to have on visiting shoppers.

										At numerous intervals during the product’s development, my team and I held user feedback sessions with members of staff and the public. We employed various methods to enlist random strangers; these included stopping employees on their way into work in the Co-operative Group’s head office, and asking them to use and evaluate the prototype product (they were compensated for their time with a free coffee voucher!)
									</p>
									<p>
										The testing aimed to answer several questions:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											How easy is it for users to achieve certain tasks?

										<li>

<p>
The user testing I did was extremely valuable, and produced several valuable lessons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users liked the idea of seeing recipes that used ingredients that were available in Co-op Food stores, and wanted this feature to be promoted to be more visible in the product.</li>
  <li>Users wanted to interact with the contents of the product - namely the deals and recipes. Several suggested a mechanism for 'liking' the content, like one might do on Facebook or other social apps.</li>
  <li>One of the features users liked the most, was the rich imagery showing several products - like the existing paper-based Co-op Food magazine, this is a great opportunity for the business to promote its best assets - its quality produce.</li>
</ul>
<p>These findings led me to several important conclusions about users' goals and desires when using such a product.
<p>
<p>Based on these conclusions, I then began to sketch out ideas for a customer journey within a mobile phone app. These initial sketches and ideas can be seen below.
</p>
<div>
<img src="img/landscape1.jpg" alt="Hand-sketched design for the new app number 1">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<div>
<img src="img/landscape2.jpg" alt="Hand-sketched design for the new app number 2">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
Based on the above findings, I have produced visual designs for the Co-operative Food’s native app. The user journey begins with a splash screen that they see when they first open the native app, having downloaded it from the Apple/Google Play Store.
</p>
<div>
<img src="img/screenshot1.png" alt="Set 1 photoshop designs for the new app">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
Once inside the app, they are greeted by a landing page that promotes several current in-store deals, but also has a 'hero' banner promoting specific recipes that can be made using ingredients on sale in Co-operative Food stores.
</p>
<div>
<img src="img/screenshot2.png" alt="Set 2 photoshop designs for the new app">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
The alternative 'hero' banner in the designs is based around a specific seasonal event: in the design shown here, it is promoting Valentine's Day. Clicking on this element will take the user to a new screen containing specific deals related to that seasonal event.
</p>
<div>
<img src="img/screenshot3.png" alt="Set 3 photoshop designs for the new app">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
The app also gives users the ability to sign up/sign in. Signing in gives them access to several more advanced features - in this example, the ability to either create a shopping list of items, or to mark specific deals as "Favourites". Each deal has a small call to action (CTA) resembling a star next to it, which allows signed in users to add it to their list of favourites. If the user clicks the star CTA without first signing in, then they are prompted to do so.
</p>
<div>
<img src="img/screenshot4.png" alt="Set 4 photoshop designs for the new app">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
The main change features of the new design are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Specific 'hero' banners that are designed to prominently display specific items, so that they are given maximum visibility and attention by webpage users.</li>
  <li>Purpose-built pages that are linked to from the 'hero' banners, where viewers can find out more information about these deals.</li>
  <li>The ability to 'like' specific items (one possible way to do this is via the use of a "star" call-to-action), which adds items to a special 'shopping list' that viewers can review later on at their leisure.</li>
<li>The ability to 'like' items and add them to a private list, necessitates the ability to sign up/sign in using a username/email address and password.</li>
<li>Specific and detail-rich pages giving complex recipes, involving dishes that can be made using ingredients that are exclusively available at Co-operative Food stores.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also, I produced a clickable prototype using these designs, which can be accessed at MarvelApp using the following
<a style="color: blue" href="https://marvelapp.com/1719139">link</a>.

<p>The Co-operative Food division is a retail brand with several unique and strong advantages. It has an extremely well-established and unique reputation as an ethical retailer, and a purveyor of quality products. It offers extremely convenient shop locations, with over 2,500 locations in the United Kingdom alone.</p>
<p>For these reasons, during our tenure my team and I concluded the best way for the Co-operative to achieve its objectives of increased revenue and profitability was simply to emphasise these strengths as much as possible via its digital channels. This is something the Co-operative has failed to do in the past - it has focused on traditional, well-established supply chains and has neglected developing channels such as mobile and web. This needs to change if the Co-operative Food business is to survive and thrive.</p>
<p>As part of this project, I designed responsive webpages that accentuate the quality and availability of the Co-operative's products. It also showcased them in the context of various seasonal deals, such as Christmas and Valentine's Day.</p>
<p>If I were to expand further on this project, my next step would have been potentially be to further accentuate the convenience and availability of the Co-operative Food branches. Perhaps I could have done this by adding a prominent, easy-to-access store locator feature that used Google Maps or similar technology to showcase just how closeby each Co-op Food store was.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the designs here represented just the first step in the Co-operative Food's journey to embrace digital media.<p>

							<p>I was approached by a friend who works for the organisation. They asked me to review Oxfam’s existing 'digital' (i.e. online) presence, from a user experience (UX) perspective; identify any existing pain points or areas of friction to users; to suggest ways to improve the UX; and finally to demonstrate how these suggestions will enable users to achieve their goals more easily as well as enabling Oxfam themselves to better achieve their business goals.</p>
      <p>I produced a map to identify all the potential channels via which a customer might engage with the organisation. Of these, when I mapped them out, I found that the main website was by far the easiest and most cost-effective means of influencing customer habits and behaviour. See the below map for details.</p>

									<p>Using the map shown below, I decided the most important part of the brief is to find ways to change the user experience that customers have with Oxfam’s webpage in order to stimulate a greater level of charitable donations, and therefore secure the long-term sustainability of the charity.</p>
							
									<img src="img/user_map2.png" alt="User awareness channel map">
									<p>The current Oxfam homepage at the time of this study is displayed below. It is a fairly effective, responsive website (i.e. it dynamically adjusts its shape and composition dependent upon the viewport meeting specific pre-determined breakpoints). It allows customers to perform a number of tasks:</p>
									<ul>
									  <li>Make donations.</li>
									  <li>Sign up to receive emails from Oxfam.</li>
									  <li>Find the locations of Oxfam clothes shops.</li>
									  <li>Find detailed information on Oxfam the charitable organisation.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Therefore, these are the specific user tasks that I shall focus on and use to evaluate the effectiveness of the website.

I gathered a group of users who did not have specific experience of using the website. I then asked each of them to complete certain key user tasks, corresponding to the list of key tasks outlined above. During the exercise I used handwritten sheets for each of the individual “usability reports” in the survey, to document the findings of each person in raw form.
As previously mentioned, the tasks that I had them complete one at a time, without assistance, were as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make a donation of 50 pence to Oxfam (funded by me the test director.)</li>
  <li>Sign up to receive emails monthly from Oxfam.</li>
  <li>Find the full location and post code of my nearest Oxfam clothes shop.</li>
  <li>Find detailed information on the founding mission of Oxfam the charitable organisation.</li>
</ul>

Following these usability sessions, I then interviewed the participants to collect their ideas on how to make the website more appealing and make it easier for users to achieve their goals.

As a result of conducting this user testing, there are a number of potential suggestions that could be enacted.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
        In general, the header at the top of the homepage is too busy (i.e. there are too many items presented) and they are not distinct enough from one another. One user specifically suggested we remove the dropdown at the top of the page that contains duplicates of some of the links from the header, but even if we don't do this specific change, there is clearly a need for simplification.
      </li>
      <li>
        There could potentially be better links placed into the accented banner in the header, for example one named “Shop in-store” might help.
      </li>
<li>
In general, there are too many fields and inputs present across the entire page.</li>
<li>
  The shop finder panel is not prominent enough, considering how important this is.</li>
  
<li>Certain links currently in the header might benefit from being moved from their current location into the footer to make others more prominent.</li>
<li>Navigation - the links/nav structure tree around volunteering would benefit from specifically being simplified for greater effect.</li>
<li>Some testers suggested we consider demoting or entirely removing the option to register for an account with Oxfam, as it is too similar to signing up for email, but with confusingly different implications.</td>
<li>Similarly to other links, some testers suggested we move the email sign-up panel to the top of the page so that it is more visible to users.</li>
</ul>

To help participants better formulate their ideas, I asked them to record them in written form. Secondly to encourage their creativity, I asked participants to convey their ideas using images, and also use the “rose, thorn, bud” format to elicit positive feedback, negative feedback and suggestions on which aspects of the idea possessed the most future potential.
</p>
<div>
<img src="img/scan2.png" alt="Actual user suggestion sheet">
<img src="img/thebigidea-capture_email_land.jpg" alt="Idea Capture Forms">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
Using this method, I was able to elicit  a large volume of divergent ideas and suggestions. This was entirely preferable  to producing a limited number  of suggestions myself, because there was no chance of my individual creativity  matching that of a large number of people. I then used these ideas as the basis for new webpage designs.

<p>The solution that emerged during the ideation stage, was that the key customer goals identified above should be accentuated, and emphasised to appear as prominently as possible.</p>
<p>There are currently on the website too many options and calls to action, with the end result that a user's focus is diffused between all of them.</p>
<p>Therefore the theme of any new design will be too reduce the number of CTAs and to accentuate them as much as possible.</p>
<div>
  <img src="img/mobile_web.png" alt="New Wireframe Designs">
  During this stage, I created designs for a variety of viewport sizes. In these two illustrations I planned how the site would display differently on a mobile phone viewport (above) and a desktop computer/laptop viewport(below).
<img src="img/friday1.png" alt="New Wireframe Designs">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>
After designing several suggestions, I began to centre around a concept that included elements from the previous design, but improved upon it by adding emphasis and new elements that would make it easier for users to complete their goals.
</p>
<div>
<p>
The final updated version of the homepage is displayed below. The following specific changes were made in response to feedback by testers, and the ideas that they generated:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>1A. A new prominent item incorporated into the header’s banner called “Shop in-store”.
  </li>
<li>1B. No drop-down in the header, as this was confusing to users and a duplication of links available elsewhere.</li>
<li>3. The email sign-up panel is now in the header so that it is more obvious to users.</li>
<li>
4. Both the email sign-up and shop finder panels in the header are far more prominent now.
</li>
<li>
5. The option to register for Oxfam has been moved down to the page footer, as users were confusing this with signing up to receive emails.</li>
<li>
6. Some other links from the header have been moved to the footer to reduce confusion.
</li>
<li>
7. I have added another large, prominent ‘call to action’ button to encourage donations.
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<img src="img/to-be_homepage.png" alt="New Webpage Design">
  <p>
  </p>
</div>
<p>Ultimately, I was able to present my friend who worked for Oxfam with a proposal for a set of changes that I believe based on testing will improve the effectiveness of their website, as well as designs setting out my specific suggestion for how the website should be repurposed to appear.

The Oxfam homepage has a number of vitally important user goals. These goals are overall reasonably easy to accomplish, but when tested with a group of users that had never used the site before, it was found that several elements of the site were arranged sub-optimally. The proposed new design above, is just one single suggestion of how the site could be altered in order to hopefully improve its performance and overall usability.</p><p>Following these design changes, I carried out more usability testing with new users, and found that the relative rate of success for the actions set out above was considerably more as a result.</p><p>However - this is only one of a myriad approaches that could be adopted. I recommend that the owners of this site implement A/B, or ‘split’ testing (by sending users at random to one of several different versions of the site, and then monitoring the overall usage analytics for each different site). This will allow them to experiment with several different changes to the arrangement of page elements, and quickly establish through the use of objective data which is most effective. I also recommend that the owners of the site be prepared to frequently re-test their site with new users, as frequent customer feedback is one of the most effective ways to continually optimise a website or piece of software.
